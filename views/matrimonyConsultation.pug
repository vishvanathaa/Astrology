However even though they have known each other for some time, often after marriage, they are disillusioned and find themselves incompatible for each otherâ€¦.Was this a wrong choice of life partner? How to avoid such deceptions? 

            p &nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the times of the reign of Kings in ancient India up to now, people from all walks of life have sought the advice of Astrologers before taking up any project or major decision.
